  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>In Steven Universe, the world is protected from evil threats by the Crystal Gems, a movement of Gems sworn to protect the Earth from the Homeworld Gems. Their powers flow from their gemstones; magical gems embedded somewhere on the host's body. The four Crystal Gems are: Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven. A Gem named Peridot has also joined the team. Steven is a young half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited a gemstone from his mother, a Crystal Gem named Rose Quartz, who gave up her form to create Steven. As Steven tries to figure out the secrets to using his gem, he spends his days in Beach City doing activities with the other Crystal Gems, whether it's helping them save the universe or just hanging out.

<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>In the context of the show, Steven is the son of Greg Universe, a human musician, and Rose Quartz, the former leader of the Crystal Gems. Rose is described as having "given up her physical form to bring [Steven] into the world" as the first Gem-human hybrid; her rose quartz gemstone is embedded in his navel.[4] At the time of the show's narrative, he is 12â€“14 years old, but appears younger (due to the interaction of his gem's magic with his aging process). Steven is caring, protective, brave, gentle, quick to make friends and forgive others, and eager to help the people he loves with their problems; his optimism is often a source of strength for the other Crystal Gems. His gem gives him a wide range of magical abilities; one of the long-term story arcs of the series is his progress in learning about and mastering these abilities, beginning in the first episode with his first successful attempt to summon his "Gem weapon", a shield. Other long-lasting character arcs involving Steven include his anxiety about filling his mother's place in the Crystal Gems and living up to her example, and his developing friendship with his human best friend, Connie.

    <p>
    Steven Universe features songs and musical numbers produced by Sugar along with her story writers, who collaborate on the lyrics for each song. According to Sugar, not every episode is meant to feature a song. She has instead opted to use them only occasionally to avoid forcing creativity.Rebecca Sugar writes songs for the series during her travels, and uses her ukele for assistance. Most of the incidental music is composed by chiptune/piano duo Aivi and Surasshu, with guitars by Stemage. The theme song of the show was made during this time, and wrote multiple drafts of the lyrics. The extended theme song was composed during her waiting in line for a airport security check in LAX from Los Angeles.The show relies heavily on leitmotifs for its soundtrack, with various instruments, genre influences, and melodies allocated to specific characters as they appear on screen. Embedded in the music are influences from pop artists such as Michael Jackson and Estelle herself.A first soundtrack album, Steven Universe Soundtrack: Volume 1, was released on June 2, 2017.The soundtrack debuted at number 22 on the Billboard 200, and number 2 on the Soundtracks chart.
